<H1>ProCom/CaPrI and the Shell ProTop</H1>


<H3>ProCom</H3>

ProCom is a theorem prover written in <A
HREF="http://www.icparc.ic.ac.uk/eclipse">ECLiPSe</A>
Prolog. It is based on the PTTP paradigm.
<P>

ProCom is highly configurable. This means adaptability at
various levels. ProCom has dozens of flags which influence its
behaviour. The intermediate Prolog program which is generated to
perform the proof task is made up of small pieces of Prolog
code. Those pieces are collected in libraries and can be completely
exchanged by the user.
<P>

To go further, even the inference rules to be used can be specified by
the user. This can be done using the calculi programming interface CaPrI.


<H3>CaPrI</H3>

CaPrI is the Calculi Programming Interface of ProCom. This interface
allows the user to program various calculi. Those high level
descriptions of calculi are used to controll the translation in a
PTTP-like mannor.


<H3>ProTop</H3>

ProTop is a shell for theorem provers. It provides means for the
automation of experiments with internal and external theorem
provers. Internal theorem provers are theorem provers written in
Prolog which are loaded into the system and make use of the features
of ProTop. External theorem provers are separate programs which are
called by some interface modules from within ProTop.
 <P>

Currently the internal provers ProCom and Pool are part of thye
distribution. The external provers <A

and <A
HREF="http://wwwjessen.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/forschung/reasoning/setheo.html">Setheo</A>
are prepared to be used from within ProTop. Only the interface modules
are included in the distribution.

<H3>Getting ProCom</H3>

You can get ProCom per ftp from <A
HREF="http://koralle.htwk-leipzig.de/pub/ProCom/procom.tar.gz">koralle.htwk-leipzig.de:pub/ProCom/procom.tar.gz</A>.
 <P>

Unpack it with the command
<LISTING>
  gunzip &lt; procom.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
</LISTING>
This will create a directory ProCom. This directory contains the files
README and INSTALL. Follow the instructions mentioned there to install
the program.
