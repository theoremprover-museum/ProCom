The ProCom distribution  comes in a single tar  file procom-VV.tar.gz  where VV
stands for a version number. First, you have to choose a place where to install
ProCom. Change the  current directory to this directory  and execute the  shell
command

	gunzip < SomeDir/procom-VV.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

where SomeDir is the directory  where the distribution  file is located.   This
command generates a  directory   named ProCom which contains   the distribution
files.


Run the shell command 

	make install INSTALLDIR=your_installation_directory

to install ProTop in the directory ``your_installation_directory''. If you want
to install it in place use INSTALLDIR=.

make   will try  to    guess  the place    where   ProCom has  been  installed.
Unfortunately sometimes this may fail and may produce wrong pathnames. Thus you
should check the Makefile and change the value of HERE appropriately.

ECLiPSe saved states  named protop and protop.st will  be generated. The  file
protop is executable and should be placed on your  search path. Obviously this
step requires ECLiPSe to be installed.

Consult the user documentation Doc/manual.tex for further details.
