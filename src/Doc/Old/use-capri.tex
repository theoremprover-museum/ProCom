\ProCom{} is a family of theorem provers which can be used out of the box as
well as a test bed for developing own theorem provers. The techniques uses in
\ProCom{} are close to PTTP-like theorem provers \cite{stickel:prolog}. We
will not assume any knowledge on these techniques but it might help
understanding some of the details.

Implementing this paradigm means to translate a given problem into a Prolog
program which behaves like a theorem prover. A overview of this idea can be
seen in figure~\ref{overview}.

The first phase of a proof attempt takes a problem --- typically in the
language of first order logic --- and translates it into Prolog clauses. This
task is performed by the \ProCom{} system. The result is a Prolog program.
This Prolog program may contain specific constructs of the target Prolog
dialect.\footnote{Currently only \eclipse\ and Quintus Prolog are supported.}

Even so it is not necessary we will sketch the way \ProCom{} works.  After the
problem has been read and stored in matrix form, a preprocessor is applied
which performs several reductions. The reduced matrix is translated into
Prolog code in four phases. One phase takes the clauses of the matrix,
clusters them in procedures and generates code for those procedures. A second
phase translates the set of goals. Goals deserve a special treatment which is
different from usual procedurs. A third phase is adds Prolog code from a
library. The final phase consists of an optimizer which tries to remove
redundencies from the generated Prolog code.

\newpage
Having in mind this scheme simply using \ProCom{} goes as follows. First, a
problem is specified. This means it is written into a file in an extended
Prolog notation. Another file containing various options to controll the
behaviour of \ProCom{} may be used. Those input files are given to \ProCom.
The result is a stand-alone Prolog program. This Prolog program can be
executed. 

As a minimal result the answer {\tt yes} or {\tt no} is given (if any).
Additional the presentation of a answer substitution or even a complete proof
tree can be achieved.

\section{Creating a Stand-Alone Executable}



\subsection{Installing \ProCom}\label{sec:installation}

The \ProCom{} distribution comes in a single tar file {\sf procom-{\em
VV}.tar.Z} where {\em VV} stands for a version number. First, you have to
choose a place where to install \ProCom. Change the current directory to this
directory and execute the shell command

|  uncompress < |{\sf {\em SomeDir/}procom-{\em VV}.tar.Z} {\tt\char"7C} | tar -xvf -|

where {\em SomeDir}\/ is the directory where the distribution file is located.
This command generates a directory named {\sf ProCom} which contains the
distribution files.


Run the shell command 

|  make config|

to generate the configuration file. This command will try to guess the place
where \ProCom{} has been installed. Unfortunately sometimes this may fail and
may produce wrong pathnames in {\sf config.pl}. Thus you should check this file
and change the value of |HERE| in {\sf Makefile} appropriately.

Finally run the shell command

|  make procom|

This will generate an \eclipse{} saved state named {\sf procom}. This file is
executable and should be placed on your search path. Obviously this step
requires \eclipse{} to be installed and accessible under the name |xeclipse|.

The saved state |procom| will try to automatically start an appropriate
interface. If it is desirable to use the Prolog interface you can make a saved
state |procom.st| which just contains the preloaded Prolog files without
starting anything automatically. This is done with the command

|  make procom.st|



\subsection{Recompiling \ProCom}\label{sec:recompile}

When you are recompiling \ProCom{} you have to consider some points.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Change the current directory to the installed \ProCom.
	We assume that \ProCom{} is properly installed.
  \item Edit the file {\sf ProCom/procom\_config.pl}\/ to reflect the provers
	which are loaded into the final executable
  \item Make sure that the libraries are located by absolute path names only.
	This is strongly recommended to allow any user from any directory to
	use \ProCom{} without problems.
  \item Run the shell command

	|  make PROCOM=|{\em name}

	where {\em name}\/ is the name of the final executable. When this
	command is finished without errors the executable {\em name}\/ can be
	tested.
\end{itemize}
