\ProCom{} is a family of theorem provers which can be used out of the box as
well as a test bed for developing own theorem provers. The techniques uses in
\ProCom{} are close to PTTP-like theorem provers \cite{stickel:prolog}. We
will not assume any knowledge on these techniques but it might help
understanding some of the details.

Implementing this paradigm means to translate a given problem into a Prolog
program which behaves like a theorem prover. A overview of this idea can be
seen in figure~\ref{overview}.

The first phase of a proof attempt takes a problem --- typically in the
language of first order logic --- and translates it into Prolog clauses. This
task is performed by the \ProCom{} system. The result is a Prolog program.
This Prolog program may contain specific constructs of the target Prolog
dialect.\footnote{Currently only \eclipse\ and Quintus Prolog are supported.}

Even so it is not necessary we will sketch the way \ProCom{} works.  After the
problem has been read and stored in matrix form, a preprocessor is applied
which performs several reductions. The reduced matrix is translated into
Prolog code in four phases. One phase takes the clauses of the matrix,
clusters them in procedures and generates code for those procedures. A second
phase translates the set of goals. Goals deserve a special treatment which is
different from usual procedures. A third phase is adds Prolog code from a
library. The final phase consists of an optimizer which tries to remove
redundancies from the generated Prolog code.

Having in mind this scheme simply using \ProCom{} goes as follows. First, a
problem is specified. This means it is written into a file in an extended
Prolog notation. Another file containing various options to control the
behavior of \ProCom{} may be used. Those input files are given to \ProCom.
The result is a stand-alone Prolog program. This Prolog program can be
executed.

As a minimal result the answer {\tt yes} or {\tt no} is given (if any).
Additional the presentation of a answer substitution or even a complete proof
tree can be achieved.

\ProTop\ is a shell which contains the functionality needed to run a theorem
prover. Even so \ProTop\ has been developed in parallel to \ProCom\ it
provides a more general environment. This is demonstrated by linking the
theorem prover otter \cite{mccune:otter} to \ProTop.
