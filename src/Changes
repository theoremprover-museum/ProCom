\begin{Changes}	
\item none
\end{Changes}

\LogDate{Changes in Version 1.69  }{Mon Jul  3 13:36:28 MET DST 1995}
%----------------------------------

\begin{Changes}	
\item prove: Automatic options are reset to their initial value properly. This
  fixes a minor bug in previous releases.
\end{Changes}

\LogDate{Changes in Version 1.68  }{Fri Jun 23 08:36:49 MET DST 1995}
%----------------------------------

\begin{Changes}	
\item ProCom: The justifications in the proof tree do no longer contain mere
  output constructors. 

  The name of a descriptor is made the first element of a justification --- if
  one has been given.
\end{Changes}

\LogDate{Changes in Version 1.67  }{Thu May 18 14:58:02 MET DST 1995}
%----------------------------------

\begin{Changes}	
\item none
\end{Changes}

\LogDate{Changes in Version 1.66  }{Mon May 15 22:04:00 MET DST 1995}
%----------------------------------

\begin{Changes}	
\item ProCom: capricore is now responsible for providing the proof tree. The
  user info is stored there but the user has no deeper control. Thus it is
  possible to define a consistent structure of the proof tree.

\item matrix: minor ugliness in |show_matrix/2| eliminated.

\item ProCom: The main predicate |goal/1| saves its argument in the predicate
  |log_file/1|. Thus other libraries can write something to the log file.
\end{Changes}

\LogDate{Changes in Version 1.65  }{Thu May  4 15:08:56 MET DST 1995}
%----------------------------------

\begin{Changes}	
\item The command line flag |-a| has been added to automatically load the
  compatibility file {\sf ancient.pt}.

\item The target |.emacs| has been added to the {\sf Makefile}. This target
  creates a file {\sf .emacs} which loads the pt-mode appropriately. This
  target is triggered automatically with\\
  |  make config|

\item ProTop: instruction |op/3| introduced. Old operators in {\sf ancient.pt}
  defined appropriately.
\end{Changes}

\LogDate{Changes in Version 1.64  }{Mon May  1 21:53:18 MET DST 1995}
%----------------------------------

\begin{Changes}
\item A major mode for GNU-Emacs to edit ProTop script files has been included
  in the distribution in {\sf Emacs/pt-mode.el}.

\item ProTop: The |call| instruction is more robust now. Undefined predicates
  should not lead to a crash any more.

\item The message |bye| issued at the end of protop. has been eliminated.

\item The format of the log file has been changed and expanded. Additional
  information is stored there. E.g. the contrapositives. The report generating
  routines in {\sf ProTop/proof\_report} have been updated accordingly.

\item ProTop: The commands |report_matrix| and |report_options| are obsolete.
  They are subsumed by the option |prove:log_items|. Thus they have been
  removed.

\item ProTop: command |report| introduced to bundle all report related
  commands. The commands |report_|* are obsolete. |report| and the associated
  keywords are declared as prefix operators to allow a simple notation. The
  operator declarations for the commands |report_|* have been removed.

  With the new commands you can write\\
  |  report title "Experiments with ProCom".|\\
  instead of the old variant\\
  |  report_title("Experiments with ProCom").|
  
  Note that obsolete commands can still be used if the compatibility file {\sf
    ancient} is included in a {\sf .protop} file or a script file.

\item ProTop: the commands |status|, |list|, and |show| are defined
  synonymously. They can also present options and macros.

  The command |show_macro| is obsolete. The samme effect can be achieved with
  |show macro|.

  The command |list_option| is obsolete. The same effect can be achieved with
  |list option|.

  The command |show| has been generalized. The old meaning is preserved if the
  argumennnt is a string.

\item ProTop: the command version has been obsolete for a long time. Now it is
  removed.

\item ProTop: |delete_macro| renamed to |delete macro|. Both stay visible
  until other delete commands occur.

\item File {\sf Changes} introduced to document user visible changes.
